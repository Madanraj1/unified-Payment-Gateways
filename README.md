# Unified Payment Gateway

lets describe the problem first
there are lots of payment gateways platforms which provides their own credential and their own way of integration 
1. have to maintain code base for each gateway
2. have to handle different endpoints for each gateway

so the solution is payment Orchestration
his involves connecting to different payment service providers (PSPs), and banks on a single, unified software layer.

let me try to build a  package for node and flutter what should be the name of the package? ðŸ¤”  let me know if you have any interesting name,i am not able to think of one now,for now will call it UPGs -unified payment gateway BTW this service is also offered by juspay (its paid)
